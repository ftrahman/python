1. Like any new piece of technology invented, there are major advantages and some pretty severe disadvantages when it comes to computational models. While computational models help to provide an outlook into the futures that we could potentially experience, such as stock market habits and climate change, it is difficult to determine how much we can trust these models are accurate. Computers depends on data manipulation and trends, and are not susceptible to random variables or erratic events unless programmed to be, and so we are at a disadvantage when it comes to the confidence behind computational models. Nevertheless, they provide us with an outcome to consider and plans solutions for.
