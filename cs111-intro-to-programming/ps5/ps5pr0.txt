1) There’s no doubt that the future of computers is progressing at an exponential rate and that there is so much to look forward to in terms of technological developments. However, I do think it’s a bit of a stretch to for computers to ever achieve human consciousness. I think they will be able to perform tasks in a millisecond that would take us ten minutes to do, and perhaps they’ll gain a human comprehension of certain topics, but they’ll never understand the emotional or moral implications behind what it means to be inherently human.

2)I believe once you’re right a couple times, there is a tendency to believe that you will continue to be right in your future predictions. I don’t think Kurzweil is saying anything truly out of the realm of possibilities for the future, rather that the rate at which it will happen is unrealistic. There will be so much trial and error in trying to achieve a fraction of the predictions he has made.
