The second prompt:
    I agree with the article to a certain extent, because while it's true that we don't need models, that doesn’t mean they are completely useless. I think that to get to the basic, a model isn’t needed because you are establishing such a simple program. However, I believe that from that point on, when things start being more complex and less simple, that a model is a very useful starting place. Yes, a model can be thrown out and begun again or restructured in a way that better leads to the goal, but I think there is a certain infrastructure needed to get to more higher and complicated levels of understanding.
