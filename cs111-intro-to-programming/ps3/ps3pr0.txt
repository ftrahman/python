1. I think that the most important point made within the article is how researchers are able to trick cells into producing themselves by adding instructions in the form of synthetic genes. I think this is such a clever and straightforward innovation because it allows for the cell to regenerate itself and allows for more complex molecular circuits to be built.

2. This problem definitely mimics last weeks gene recursion problem because we were coding for DNA to RNA and then transcription. It’s definitely similar in that we were providing the base pairs and coming up with algorithms to produce gene pairs. I’m sure that the coding mentioned in the article is much more advanced but it’s really neat to read the article and see that we are doing a fraction of what advanced computer scientists are doing.
