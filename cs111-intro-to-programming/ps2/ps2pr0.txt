1) The most interesting part of this article for me was how researchers and engineers are going to collaborate to create a cybernetic physician’s assistant. It truly shows how technology has progressed within the past few years especially and the progress we’re making in our efforts. I feel as though Watson’s technologies can be used for a number of different fields. In medicine in particular, Watson may come to diagnose patients better than doctor’s will, do astronomical calculations for us, and detect bugs in other computers. Maybe one day Watson will be writing codes for other programs. Emotion will always distinguish technology from humans. I don’t think science could ever advance to include that emotional capacity within a robot or a computer. For that reason, I believe humans will always be more advanced. We can think logically and emotionally. Watson, however, cannot.
