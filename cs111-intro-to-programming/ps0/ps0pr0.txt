1. The only times in which language has ever gotten in the way for me would probably be in pronunciation. Often times I’ve been in conservations or around friends who pronounce things funny to me. I’ve also been that person in conversations. I wouldn’t say it prevents me from communicating anything, but there were people who got frazzled when they didn’t like the way I pronounced an English word. Only other communications that have gotten in the way of things that I wanted to accomplish would probably be cross languages, but that’s a given.
2. Artificial languages are definitely fundamentally different from human thought because although there are highly advanced computer systems, computers will never be able to synthesize human emotion which drives a lot of our language and the way we choose to communicate with others.
