1. Computers are much more different than humans, and I remain by this point as I previously have, because the one thing computers lack is the human conscious, most of which is generated by emotion. Computers will always lack the ability to truly configure to reasoning based on human instinct and decision making.

2. Computers will not necessarily always need to have human assistance, because there are robots that exist today from Boston Gaming Company that are able to move and whatnot on their own and simulate movement. I do, think, however, that in a sense, computers will never be able to build themselves because that level of technology is unfathomable, at least to little me in CS 111. For that reason, computers may always need human assistance.
